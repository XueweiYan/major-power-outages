# major-power-outages
This project is an analysis on the dataset of major power outages in the US from January 2000 to July 2016 in the language of Python. The project is divided into two components - a data exploration part and a data modelling part. Before using an unfamiliar dataset for modelling, the first thing is always to understand the contents of dataset. In the data exploration part, distribution of categorical data, missingness of variables, and correlationship between columns are all addressed. The data modelling part takes advantage of the exploratory findings and builds a regression model to predict the duration of future outages.
