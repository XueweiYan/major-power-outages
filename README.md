# major-power-outages
This project is an analysis of the dataset of major power outages in the US from January 2000 to July 2016 in the language of Python. The project is divided into two components - a data exploration part and a data modeling part. Before using an unfamiliar dataset for modeling, the first thing is always to understand the contents of the dataset. In the data exploration part, the distribution of categorical data, missingness of variables, and correlations between columns are all addressed. The data modeling part takes advantage of the exploratory findings and builds a regression model to predict the duration of future outages.
